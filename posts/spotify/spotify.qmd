## Loading the Dataset
```{python}
import pandas as pd
spotify = pd.read_csv('https://bcdanl.github.io/data/spotify_all.csv')
spotify.info()
```
## Variable Description

* pid: playlist ID; unique ID for playlist
* playlist_name: a name of playlist
* pos: a position of the track within a playlist (starting from 0)
* artist_name: name of the trackâ€™s primary artist
* track_name: name of the track

* album_name: name of the trackâ€™s album

## Filtering
I will filter for one of my favorite artists: Shakira.
```{python}
shakira = spotify[ spotify["artist_name"] == "Shakira"]
shakira
```

## Indexing and Sorting
```{python}
shakira= (
          shakira
          .set_index("pid")
          .sort_index(ascending=True)
)
shakira.sort_values(by = ["playlist_name", "pos"],
                    ascending = True)
```

## Counting
```{python}
shakira.nunique()
```
There are 116 unique playlists that have atleast 1 Shakira song in it.
```{python}
shakira['playlist_name'].value_counts()
```
The playlist with the most Shakira songs is "ðŸ’ƒ" with 9 songs included.

```{python}
shakira["track_name"].value_counts()
```
The most popular song (added to playlist the most times) is "Hips Don't Lie".
