## What is Python?

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language.

## Variables and Data Types

Variables can store data of different types. There are many different data types.

```{python}
integer_variable = 10
string_variable = 'Hello'
float_variable = 10.5
boolean_variable = True
nothing_variable = None
```

## Control Structures

Python supports basic conditions from math:
```{python}
# Equals: a == b
# Not Equals: a != b
# Less than: a < b
# Less than or equal to: a <= b
# Greater than: a > b
# Greater than or equal to: a >= b
```

## Lists, Dictionaries, and Tuples
A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable.

A dictionary is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed.

A tuple is a collection which is immutable.
```{python}
# List example:
my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']

# Dictionary example:
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 36}

# Tuple example:
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
```
## for Loops
A loop is a way of executing a piece of code over and over 
```{python}
name_list = ["Ben", "Chris", "Kate", "Mary"]

for name in name_list:
    print(name)
```

## Slicing Methods

An index is the position of a specific element in a sequence. Indexing in Python starts with 0.

Slicing is a way to get a subset of a data object.

You can slice by using square brackets [], a start index, and an end index. You can also incude a "step" count to determine how you want to skip position by.

format: [start : end : step]
```{python}
string = "abcdefghijklmnaop"
print( string[1 : 6 : 2] )
```
## Importing Modules, Packages, and Libraries
A module is a group of related codes saved in a file with the extension .py

A package is a directory of a collection of modules

A library is a collection of packages

You can import modules, open Anaconda Prompt or Terminal and run:
```{python}
pip install module_name
```
To install a module on Google Colab add a excalamation point ! in the beginning
## Practice Problems

Question 1.

Using Python operations only, calculate below:
```{python}
2**5/(7*(4-2**3))
```
Question 2.

For each expression below, what is the value of the expression? Explain thoroughly.
```{python}
20 == '20'
```
False, because the integer 20 is not equal to the string 20.
```{python}
x = 4.0
y = .5
z = 3*y - x

x < y or 3*y < x
```
True because by using "or" you only need one of the statements to be true. So although one is false, because the other is true, the whole expression is true.

Question 3.

Write a Python code that uses slicing and the print() function to print out the following message:

The total trip cost is: $12.80
```{python}
fare = "$10.00"
tip = "2.00$"
tax = "$ 0.80"
```
```{python}
total= fare[1] + tip[0] + "." + tax[4:6]
print("The total trip is: $" + total)
```
Question 4.

Write a Python code that uses print() and max() functions to print out the largest value in the list, list_variable, as follows:

The largest value in the list is: 1000
```{python}
list_variable = [100, 144, 169, 1000, 8]
print("The largest value in the list is: ", max(list_variable))
```
Question 5.

Import the pandas library as pd. Install the itables package. From itables, import the functions init_notebook_mode and show.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
!pip install itables
from itables import init_notebook_mode
from itables import show
```
